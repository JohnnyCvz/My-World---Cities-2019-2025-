# My-World---Cities-2019-2025-
My old World

This is a map I started creating back in 2019, in Creative Mode. I built many things here, mostly during moments when I was feeling sad or going through something difficult. It became a place where I could turn pain into art.

I’m sharing it now for anyone who wants to explore what I created. The map is fairly large and has quite a lot of builds, most of them made between 2019 and early 2024.

I hope that anyone who visits this world can appreciate the art within it, even if it carries a melancholic tone.
